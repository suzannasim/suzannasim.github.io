<p>Hello! I am Suzanna Sim, a current second year Materials Engineering with an emphasis in Mechanical Engineering student at the University of California, Davis. An always inquisitive_______________________________________</p>
<p>When circumstances arose and I was forced to give up my main passion of archery in high school, I began thinking and coming up with ways to work with the challenges I was faced with. I utilized household appliances, bra strap hooks, leftover supplies from my high school's robotic's lab, and other miscellaneous materials I could get my hands on to create parts for my archery equipment. I would create fingertab wraps from old pant waistbands and bra strap hooks, training bands from discarded rubber from the robotics lab, bow stand legs from old shoes, and more. From this eye opening opportunity, I was exposed to a new passion, engineering. The process of facing a problem, figuring out a solution, and actually implementing my ideas into reality gave me more excitement than I had known existed and my journey into engineering began. _________________________________________________ My main interests intertwine mechanical and materials engineering and something______________________________________.</p>
<p>Currently working at the Peter A. Rock Thermochemistry Nanomaterials in the Environment, Agriculture, and Technology Laboratory - Organized Research Unit (NEAT-ORU) as a data extractor, I am making the first ever created database from high temporature melt solution research done by researchers in the United States, China, Germany, Israel, and more to allow easier access to imporant data necessary for further and easier calorimetry research. Getting to watch and read about processes that I have studied so much about in my classes is the most fulfilling and enlivening aspect and I look forward to more experiences such as these in the future.</p>
<p>_____________________Always hungry to try and learn new things, I have taken a Python course, audited Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop courses, self taught Solidworks for AMAT, and self taught HTML/CSS/JavaScript to create this very website!___________________________ </p>
<p>Aside from engineering, my other interests include graphic design, competitive archery, analyzing literature, and orchestra! I am involved in the Advanced Modeling Aeronautics Team (AMAT) as part of the fuselage team, the Society of Women Engineers, Theta Tau (a co-ed professional Engineering fraternity), and the UC Davis Symphony Orchestra as a violinist. When not in school, I can be found exploring new areas, playing around on Adobe Illustrator, people watching, having thought provoking conversations with friends, or just waffling around!</p>
