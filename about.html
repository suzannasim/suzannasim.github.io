        <h1>hi! i'm suzanna.</h1>
        <div>
            a fourth year engineering and technology management student at UC Davis, looking for opportunities in project and product management. i have a hunger for learning with a million and one different interests, resulting in experiences ranging from design and marketing to supply chain and process development to r&d and product improvement.
        
            i'm driven by creating unique experiences for myself and others, whether it's as small as making an everyday powerpoint into an interactive visual adventure, backpacking for a week along PCT, or co-founding a company and pulling a 72 hour shift to bake 1000+ personalized macarons.
            
            let's talk! shoot me a message to chat about anything.
