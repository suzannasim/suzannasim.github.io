<p>Hello! I am <strong>Suzanna Sim</strong>, a current second year <strong>Materials Engineering</strong> with a <strong>Mechanical Engineering focus</strong> student at the University of California, Davis. </p>
    
<p> As an always <strong>inquisitive</strong>, <strong>determined</strong>, and <strong>creative</strong> individual, I became aware of my interest in engineering in high school when financial circumstances forced me to give up my main passion at the time, archery. Though devastated at first, I began planning and thinking up with ways to work with the obstacle I was faced with. I utilized household appliances, bra strap hooks, leftover supplies from my high school's robotic's lab, and other miscellaneous materials I could get my hands on to create parts for my archery equipment. I would create fingertab wraps from old pant waistbands and bra strap hooks, training bands from discarded rubber from my high school's robotics lab, bow stand legs from shoe rubber, and more. From this experience, I was exposed to a new interest, engineering. The process of facing a problem, figuring out a solution, and actually implementing my ideas into reality gave me more elation and eagerness than I had known and my journey into engineering began. Since then, I have found my curiosity constantly piqued by different materials and mechanics around me everyday!</p>
    
<p>I am currently working at the <strong>Peter A. Rock Thermochemistry Nanomaterials in the Environment, Agriculture, and Technology Laboratory - Organized Research Unit (NEAT-ORU)</strong> as a data compiler, making the first  high temporature melt solution database from research done by researchers in the United States, China, Germany, Israel, and more to allow easier access to imporant data necessary for further and easier research. Getting to watch and read about processes that I have studied so much about in my classes is the most fulfilling and enlivening aspect of the job and I look forward to more experiences such as these in the future.</p>
    
<p>Always hungry to try new things, I have taken a Python course, audited Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop courses, self taught Solidworks for AMAT, and self taught HTML/CSS/JavaScript to create this very website! Aside from engineering, my other interests include <strong>programming</strong>, <strong>graphic design</strong>, <strong>archery</strong>, and <strong>orchestra</strong>! At school, I am involved in the <strong>Advanced Modeling Aeronautics Team (AMAT)</strong> as part of the fuselage team, <strong>Materials Advantage Student Chapter</strong>, <strong>the Society of Women Engineers</strong>, <strong>Theta Tau</strong> (a co-ed professional Engineering fraternity), and the <strong>UC Davis Symphony Orchestra</strong> as a violinist. When not in school, I can be found exploring new areas, playing around on Adobe Illustrator, people watching, having thought provoking conversations with friends, or just waffling around!</p>
